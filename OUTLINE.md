DISCLAIMER.

What I am about to teach you is all illegal. Federal offense! Don't do it without permission of the owner.

- Steeling a car
- Arson
- Drug trafficking
- Could be as bad or worse than murder if you were to attach a hospital's network.


- What is nmap? How do you use it?
- What is curl? How do you use it?

Going to http://qotd.netcatlabs.com:17/ fails in Firefox due to some nastiness..
BUT you can curl it :)

QOTD should be less than 512 characters:

What if one of the quotes asks for a large chunk of memory and did not \0 it? It ends with data from memory!
